* Set aside dedicated time each day to write in your gratitude journal.
* Reflect upon three things you are grateful for, whether big or small.
* Be specific and descriptive in your entries, focusing on the emotions associated with each item.
* Write freely without judgment or overthinking.

Through this practice, you'll gradually shift your focus towards the positive aspects of your work and life, fostering a sense of appreciation and contentment.
